How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    i dont know.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    This could help me make a better programer becaue i can use it to compare my new and old code if i end up having any issues with the new code i have written.
